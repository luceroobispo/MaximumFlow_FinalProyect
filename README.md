# MaximumFlow_FinalProyect

## Goals:
- Obtain the maximum flow capacity of a network between the source node and the destination node using the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm from a matrix that stores the values of the node edge capacities.
- Implement a program that solves the maximum flow problem with the C++ programming language along with the forms provided by the Windows Form for better graphics display and user interaction, and the Visual Studio 2022 code editor to display graphically in the forms the connections between the nodes of a directed graph and, in this way, show the total flow and the flow capacity of each edge of the graph before and after obtaining the maximum flow.
